This repository consists the code for our research on "Malware Classification Using Bi-Modal Deep Learning"

Here, We have used Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015) dataset. You can find the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification

In this approach, we basically used Bi-Modal Deep Learning in which both .asm and .byte files are utilized. Firstly, the .byte files were converted into visual representation of malware by converting HEX code into grayscale images. On the other hand, we extracted important features from .asm files using PE Parser. (You can check the documentation at: https://pe-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
