This repository consists the code for our research on "Malware Classification Using Bi-Modal Deep Learning"

Here, We have used Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015) dataset. You can find the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification

In this approach, we basically used Bi-Modal Deep Learning in which both .asm and .byte files are utilized. Firstly, the .byte files were converted into visual representation of malware by converting HEX code into grayscale images. On the other hand, we extracted important features from .asm files using PE Parser. (You can check the documentation at: https://pe-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Then we ustilized series of CNN layers in order to automatically extract features from malware image representation. Similarly, we used Deep Neural Network(DNN) in order to process metadata of malware extracted using PE Parser. The feature maps of both CNN and DNN were combined to get a hybrid feature map which was then passed to a classification layer. Using this approach we were able to achieve remarkable result. (Accuracy: 98.62%, Precision: 98.64%, Recall: 98.62%, F1-Score: 98.63%)
